As the sun begins to set upon the waterâ€™s surface
The gentle currents push us further and further away from the pure white boat
Even in the distance, I could hear the sounds of the motor running
Through the times spent with my sister, a sense of happiness rushes through my body

I glance back at the smiles that appear from my grandparents faces 
As I drift along the crystal clear water
My mind is clogged up with thoughts
About when I may see my whole family together again
